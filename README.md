# Form Validation Mini Project

## The Odin Project's Form Validation Assignment

This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum, focusing on client-side form validation using JavaScript.

### Key Features:

- **Client-Side Form Validation**: Implemented using JavaScript to ensure data integrity before submission.
- **Country Code and Flag Input**: Created input fields that include country codes and flags.
- **Factory Functions**: Utilized factory functions to create and manage form elements efficiently.

### What I Learned:

- **Client-Side Validation Techniques**: How to validate form inputs on the client side to provide immediate feedback to users.
- **Dynamic Input Fields**: How to dynamically create and manage input fields, including country codes and flags.
- **Factory Functions**: The benefits and implementation of factory functions for creating reusable and modular code.

### Technologies Used:

- **Core**:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript
- **Build Tools**:
  - Webpack
  - npm
- **Icons**:
  - Iconify-Icon
- **Linting**:
  - ESLint
  - Prettier

### How to Run:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Build the project using `npm run build`.
4. Open the `dist/index.html` file in your browser.
5. Interact with the form to see client-side validation in action.

### Future Improvements:

- **Server-Side Validation**: Implement server-side validation to complement client-side validation.
- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Improve the user interface and experience with more interactive elements and feedback.
